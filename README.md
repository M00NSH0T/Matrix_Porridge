Optimizing the human diet

Many COVID-19 survivors report losing their sense of smell and / or taste. While for most this returns over time, others continue to struggle with this issue months later. This problem made me remember an old project I worked on over a decade ago, way back in 2010 using Matlab. At the time, I was in my final days running my first company, right before Conservation Services Group recruited me. I was working long hours and had very little time to eat regular meals. A friend of mine and I were joking at the time that sometimes it'd be nice to just have an actually healthy meal to just eat in a hurry... one that didn't care at all about taste. 

I immediately thought back to the movie, "The Matrix" and the famous ["tasty wheat scene"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1EcrD5IyxM). Basically, in this dystopian future where the atmosphere had been ruined and nothing grew above ground, food had to be synthesized. The result was a gelatinous goop... "a single cell protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals. Everything the body needs." (The Matrix, 1999)

Now there are a million products out there that claim to be healthy meals on the go for you, but looking at the nutrition labels on these, I never really found anything that quite delivered what I wanted. All focused too much on making something "edible." But those days, I was looking for something you'd down like a shot of bad whiskey. Something that got the job done, but didn't necessarily taste good. Not a bar filled with chocolate and peanut butter.

So back to these COVID-19 survivors. Losing their sense of taste is clearly not something anyone would ask for. But perhaps there's some lemonade they can make from these lemons. 

This project aims to find the optimal list of ingredients necessary to create the perfect meal for people who can't taste. It doesn't matter if the ingredients make sense to a chef, just as long as they solve the equation and meet the dietary constraints of a typical adult.
