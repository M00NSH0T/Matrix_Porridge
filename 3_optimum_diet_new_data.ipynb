    "\n",
    "I went back to the [root data from the USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html). I used the MS Access download option for April 2021. I had to build several new queries to generate an export we can use that resembles the old format. Unfortunately, the database itself is too big to upload to GitHub, but I included the main export as an Excel sheet here which includes all the different foods within the \"survey_fndds_foods\" table, along with their categories, the full descriptions from the \"foods\" table along with the nutrition content for all the tested nutrients (I believe this is per 100g of that food). Then, I selected the categories for unprocessed, raw ingredients, at least as much I was able to. The filtered data was then copied to another worksheet, which is what we'll be working with from here on out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I still intend to use clustering technique, possibly with some refinements, to filter out similar items. Unfortunately, it appears that the descriptions for many of these foods has changed since I used this data last. \"w/ salt\" is no longer a string we can use to parse out variants of ingredients with added salt. I may have to manually scrub this."

We could potentially frame it that way... with an A matrix 2330 columns wide. But our objective function here isn't written easily as a function of pure X (our ingredients vector), no matter what we decide to optimize.\n",

This way, we can to optimize for a custom value function. SciPy's Linear Programming functionality requires that our objective be a vector, but that doesn't really work here. But there are plenty of alternatives, so we'll try a few of those. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, however, we need to define what it is we seek to optimize. Eventually, we may wish to make this something the user could select from a list of options (which would also alter constraints), to accommodate different nutrition guides, such as Atkins, or a high fiber diet. Or, maybe we seek to maximize quantity of food while still meeting nutrition guidelines. For now, I'm going to take bit of a fuzzy logic approach, with our function outputting a value that's most optimal when all nutrition requirements are exactly in the center of the ranges and where we impose serious (but linear with a slope) penalties if any nutritional requirements fall outisde the acceptable ranges."

    "SciPy's minimize function is a local optimization algorithm, with many different methods you can choose from to find a local minima based on various methods depending on whether you have bounded inputs or other constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those that unfamiliar with local vs global optimization concepts, Mathworks (the makers of Matlab) explains it quite well [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/what-is-global-optimization.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, because of the way we set up our value function with different slopes / contributions to the overall value for each nutritional category depending on whether they are inside our outside our acceptable ranges, we have made this into a nonlinear problem. What that means is that if we start at a random initial position on our value function and use something like gradient descent or Newton's method (or various other approaches) to follow the slope to the local minima, we can't be sure that this is the same as the overall or global minima, which is the true optimal solution. Our starting point and various other hyperparameters (like learning rate) matter. Check out the following graph for a visual explanation:\n",

Those starting conditions can be purely random, or they can follow some sort of search logic. SciPy offers several options. Generally, I find the dual_annealing offers a good overall performance here. But, I'm going to hold off on running that for now because it's quite slow, and as you'll see later, we have a lot of work left to do before we're ready to go for the final run."

    "There are two related issues here. First, the global optimizer ran for 4.5 hours and still didn't finish. It found a pretty good solution (better than I could find using the local optimizer on this new set), but it's high in saturated fat and sodium. But the other thing to note here is that several of the above ingredients are compound ingredients that include repeating core ingredients. Clearly there's more manual filtering I need to do on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, next I'm going to spend an hour or two manually culling the input dataset. If we were talking a longer list of ingredients, I'd probably work on doing this a bit more programmatically, but in my experience, when working with smaller datasets (<5k records), it's usually worth having a human do this part."
